Before -
LLM <-> API Layer with Apps 

After -
LLM <-> Unified API <-> MCP <-> Unique API (New way of doing things)

Standard protocol speciffy schema, functions, documentation

- MCP Hosts (Claude desktop, python app)
- MCP Clients (1:1 connection with server)
- MCP Servers (expose specific capabilities through standardized MCP)
- Local Data Sources (connect local database)
- Remote Services (APIs)

Transport Mechanishm
1. Standard IO
2. Server Sent Events (HTTP) - MCP server accessible via API

-> Rest API 
- Communicate web application (Communication Protocol)
Front end  (HTTP via Rest api)       URL  Back end (Server)
Standard - consistent way of doing something.

Model Context Protocol
Standardized way of AI agents talk with tools ex. database, google drive, iool search features
Hard to integrate lot of tools with LLM

Standardized Protocol (Tool providers write codes / services)   -> AI Agent

Transport Mechanishm
- stdio (Running local terminal, input command and output text) 
- sse (communication over network local or remote) - similar to rest api
